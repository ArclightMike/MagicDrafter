***Application is not under development.  See the Angular replacement - https://github.com/ArclightMike/angular-magic-drafter

This application lets you generate "booster packs" for drafting from your existing collection. For Magic: The Gathering drafting rules, see this link - https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft

Items still under development:
- Card buttons are generated, but the overall ui still needs work.
- Pack contents are incorrect.  It gets a random from Scryfall right now, but really needs to use their api to get the exact json of what we need.
